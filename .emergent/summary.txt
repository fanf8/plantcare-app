The previous AI engineer developed the Le potager malin application (formerly Plant Wellness), iteratively enhancing its features. The primary focus initially was on enriching the plant database, updating over 55 plant image URLs to be specific and accurate, resolving a same photo for all varieties issue. The database expanded from 37 to 64 varieties. A significant new feature, a 7-day watering calendar, was implemented, offering both automatic and customizable schedules. Debugging was required for image display and calendar interactivity, including a temporary local solution for personalized watering due to an authentication error. The application was successfully renamed. Most recently, a free/premium tier was introduced, segmenting features like the AI scanner (recognition for free, diagnosis for premium), weather, and advanced tips. The immediate next task is to add a premium-exclusive lunar calendar, for which backend implementation has just started.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Plant Wellness mobile application (Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB). Key features include Mon Jardin for plant management, an AI scanner for identification/diagnosis (premium), and community interaction. Authentication involves email/password login and admin login. The app needs a comprehensive plant database (growing from 40-50 to 64 varieties) with real photos, detailed care information (sunlight, watering, soil), and tags. UI/UX evolved from a dark theme to a white background with thematic images. Specific requests included a carousel, detailed plant sheets, filtering, renaming Ma collection to Mes plants, specific variety names, and integrating a GPT-4 Vision scanner. More recently, a 7-day watering calendar (auto and user-customizable, savable) was requested. The app was renamed to Le potager malin. A free (recognition scanner, all plants, watering calendar) vs. premium (diagnosis scanner, weather, advanced tips) tier distinction was introduced, and a premium-exclusive lunar calendar is now requested.

    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Fixed carousel display. Integrated  components.
        -   Switched to fetching plant data dynamically from the backend.
        -   Implemented UI components and logic for the Scanner IA screen, including .
        -   Added  interfaces, state (, ), and utility functions (, ).
        -   Introduced  component and integrated it into a new .
        -   Modified the  function to distinguish between identification (free) and diagnostic (premium) and show a  if unauthorized.
        -   Added styles for new calendar and premium components.
        -   Updated plant image rendering in Mes Plants to fetch correct URLs from the database.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Expo application configuration.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated  to Le potager malin and  to le-potager-malin.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the lunar calendar feature in the backend and frontend.
-   Resolve the  error when attempting to save watering schedules to the backend to enable persistence.
-   Update images for remaining plant varieties that still use generic URLs, such as Citronnier, Oranger, Betterave Rouge, CÃ©leri Branche, and Fenouil Bulbeux.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on distinguishing between the free and premium versions of the Le potager malin application. This involved modifying the backend () to incorporate premium status checks for features like the AI scanner's diagnostic capabilities, weather integration, and advanced tips. Frontend () changes were made to reflect this, including updating the  function to handle  (free) and  (premium) modes, and displaying a  for unauthorized premium access.

The user then declined to set specific pricing for the premium features but explicitly requested the addition of a **lunar calendar** feature, stating it should be **premium-only**. The AI engineer acknowledged this and has just begun the implementation of this new feature by starting with the necessary modifications to the backend, specifically in , to lay the groundwork for the lunar calendar.
